PGI: Petrophysically and Geologically Guided Geophysical Inversion
==================================================================

This tutorial show through a DC example how to use functionalities introduced in Astic & Oldenburg (2019) and Astic et al. (2020) to include petrophysical and geological information into geophysical inversions.
