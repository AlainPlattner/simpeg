SimPEG 0.14.1 Release Notes
===========================

This release contains a few small bug fixes and parameter renaming for a few
functions

Deprecations
============

Resistivity Dipole source and receiver
--------------------------------------
For the ``Dipole`` receiver in ``SimPEG.electromagnetics.static.resistivity.receivers``,
the ``locationsM`` and ``locationsN`` parameters are deprecated. They are now called
``locations_m`` and ``locations_n``. There are now two ways to create a ``Dipole`` receiver:

 .. code-block:: python

  rx = resistivity.receivers.Dipole(locations_m, locations_n)

or

.. code-block:: python

  rx = resistivity.receivers.Dipole(locations=(locations_m, locations_n))

Similarly, for the, ``Dipole`` source in ``SimPEG.electromagnetics.static.resistivity.sources``,
the ``locationA`` and ``locationB`` parameters are deprecated. They are now called
``location_a`` and ``location_b``. There are now also two ways to create a ``Dipole`` source:

.. code-block:: python

  src = resistivity.sources.Dipole(rx_list, a_loc, b_loc)

or

.. code-block:: python

  src = resistivity.sources.Dipole(rx_list, location=(a_loc, b_loc))

static module cleanups
----------------------

The following attributes and methods have been deprecated and renamed

* ``resistivity.Survey.m_locations`` -> ``resistivity.Survey.locations_m``
* ``resistivity.Survey.n_locations`` -> ``resistivity.Survey.locations_n``
* ``resistivity.Survey.a_locations`` -> ``resistivity.Survey.locations_a``
* ``resistivity.Survey.b_locations`` -> ``resistivity.Survey.locations_b``
* ``resistivity.Survey.drapeTopo`` -> ``resistivity.Survey.drape_electrodes_on_topography``
* ``utils.static_utils.gen_DCIPsurvey`` -> ``utils.static_utils.generate_dcip_survey``


Additionally the following method has been deprecated, renamed, and had a few keyword
arguments deprecated as well.

* ``utils.static_utils.plot_pseudoSection`` -> ``utils.static_utils.plot_pseudosection``
  * ``pcolorOpts`` -> ``pcolor_opts``
  * ``data_location`` -> ``data_locations``

The ``resistivity.Survey.getABMN_locations`` method is no longer necessary.
