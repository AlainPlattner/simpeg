SimPEG 0.14.1 Release Notes
===========================

This release contains a few small bug fixes and parameter renaming for a few
functions

Deprecations
============
For the ``Dipole`` receiver in ``SimPEG.electromagnetics.static.resistivity.receivers``,
the ``locationsM`` and ``locationsN`` parameters are deprecated. They are now called
``locations_m`` and ``n_locations``. There are now two ways to create a ``Dipole`` receiver:

 .. code-block:: python

  rx = resistivity.receivers.Dipole(locations_m, n_locations)

or

.. code-block:: python

  rx = resistivity.receivers.Dipole(locations=(locations_m, n_locations))

Similarly, for the, ``Dipole`` source in ``SimPEG.electromagnetics.static.resistivity.sources``,
the ``locationA`` and ``locationB`` parameters are deprecated. They are now called
``location_a`` and ``b_location``. There are now also two ways to create a ``Dipole`` source:

.. code-block:: python

  src = resistivity.sources.Dipole(rx_list, a_loc, b_loc)

or

.. code-block:: python

  src = resistivity.sources.Dipole(rx_list, location=(a_loc, b_loc))
